<strong>Yet another look into covid-19 cases in nepal</strong><br>
</p>

## Introduction

**covidnepal** is just another try to look into covidcases inside Nepal. I'm a bit late to this game but that has always been my feature, I guess. It is made to provide unreliable data and provide as many information as possible inside a same application. It depends on reliable API (after spending a months for it). This application features PWA (Progressive Web App) technology, meaning it could be installed inside the browser easily like a mobile application and later could be run like an application. This application follows **neumorphic** design style for UI & smoother animation for your eyes.


### Features

* Lists covid-cases by districts & provinces
* Tracks cases worldwide live
* Auto updating covid related news & update
* Installable on any web browser & smartphones
* Alternate way of serving through telegram bot
* Neumorphic styled layout
* Dark mode by default
